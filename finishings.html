            <h2>Matte vs Glossy Paper: Which one is right for your project?</h2>
            <p>When it comes to printing, one of the most common questions is: Should I use matte or glossy paper? Each finish has its strengths, and the best choice depends on what you’re printing, how you want it to look, and how it’ll be used.</p>

            <h3>Glossy Paper</h3>
            <p>Glossy paper has a smooth, reflective coating that enhances color and contrast. It is ideal for images that need to pop.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Best for:</strong> Photos, Marketing flyers, Brochures with visuals, Product packaging</li>
                <li><strong>Pros:</strong> Richer color vibrancy, Sharper image detail, Professional finish</li>
                <li><strong>Cons:</strong> Prone to fingerprints and glare, Difficult to write on, Not ideal for text-heavy documents</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Matte Paper</h3>
            <p>Matte paper has a non-reflective, flat finish that gives it a clean and refined look. It is easier to read and write on.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Best for:</strong> Resumes and cover letters, Art prints, Invitations, Text-heavy documents</li>
                <li><strong>Pros:</strong> No glare, Easier to handle and read, Smooth premium feel</li>
                <li><strong>Cons:</strong> Slightly muted colors, Less "wow" factor for image prints</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Pro Tip: Think About Lighting</h3>
            <p>Glossy paper looks great in natural light, but can create glare under harsh indoor lighting. Matte paper remains consistent in any setting.</p>
