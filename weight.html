            <h1>Understanding Paper Weights</h1>
            <p>
                Paper weight isn’t just about how heavy a sheet feels; it affects how your print looks, feels, and even performs. 
                Whether you’re printing a flyer, a business card, or a photo, the right weight makes all the difference.

            <h2>What is paper weight?</h2>
            <p>Paper weight is how thick and dense a sheet of paper is, usually measured in either:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>GSM (grams per square meter): most common world-wide</li>
                    <li>lbs or pts (pounds or points): commonly used in the US</li>
                </ul>
            <p>Both units refer to the paper’s thickness and sturdiness, but they’re measured differently. GSM is more precise and easier to compare across types.</p>

            <h2>GSM vs lbs… What’s the difference?</h2>
                 <ul>
                    <li>GSM measures the actual weight of paper per square meter. It’s consistent regardless of paper type</li>
                    <li>Pound (lb) measures the weight of 500 sheets in its uncut size, so it varies depending on the type (e.g., text vs. cover stock).</li>
                </ul>
            <p>That’s why two "80 lb" papers can feel totally different!</p>

            <h2>Types of Paper Stock</h2>
            <p>There are two main categories when comparing lb weights:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Text Weight: Lightweight paper used for documents (e.g. 20lb, 40lb)</li>
                    <li>Cover/Cardstock: Heavier paper for covers or cards (e.g. 80lb cover ≠ 80 lb text!)</li>
                </ul>

            <h2>Choosing the Right Paper Weight</h2>
            <p>For everyday use: 20-24lb / 75–90 GSM</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Standard for printers, schoolwork, office docs</li>
                </ul>
            <p>For professional documents: 24–32lb / 90–120 GSM</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Great for resumes, proposals, official letters</li>
                </ul>
            <p>For flyers & marketing: 35–45lb / 130–170 GSM</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Adds weight without feeling bulky</li>
                </ul>
            <p>For Photos or Premium Prints: 65–90lb / 200–250 GSM</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Durable, vibrant results</li>
                </ul>
            <p>For Business Cards or Invitations: 100+ lb / 300+ GSM / 14pt+</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Rigid, impressive quality</li>
                </ul>
